General development plan:
During the Bootstrap course: create a static, responsive version of the website.
During the React course: make the data dynamic (menus, locations, events, memberships etc...).
During the React Native course: turn the website into a mobile app.
During the NodeJS, Express, MongoDB course: move the data to MongoDB, build the REST APIs.
